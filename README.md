# Energy-in-home
Energy saving for homes
- Final project (idea) for the Building AI course


## Summary

Project is about saving enerngy and keeping house temperatures constant in varying temperatures 
along taking into consideration house/building characteristics (including people).

## Background & Data sources

While outdoor temperatures vary quite rapidly, indoor temperatures do not follow at same pace. This leads to excess 
use of energy and during transition temperature being too cool or warm. Current houses are built with energy saving
in mind and this issue is more evident than in older houses where leakages are more common. Though with automation all
sorts of building would benefit. This type of functionality would also be needed in warm periods i.e. cooling the house.

There are several data points we probably would need :
* connect to open data on weather forecast to initiate actions in advance (heat/cool)
* connect to multiple sensors in the house, including equipment like oven (provides quite much heat when use as an example)
* if solar systems (electiricity, heat) in use, create the logic to run in parallel with other equipment if feasible
* model housing characteristics (like heat absorbing capacities, ...., )
* ...


## How is it used?

From a user perspective the system shall be almost unnoticed. Obviously there would need to be some sort
of intervention possibilities, but automation is the target.
